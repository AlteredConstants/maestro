# Maestro

Early prototype of what may someday be a fencing bout committee suite
(like [Fencing Time](https://www.fencingtime.com/) only freer).

## Dev Setup

You'll need the following for your development environment:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (obviously)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [jspm](http://jspm.io/)

Install Node using the installers provided on the website, and then install jspm via command line:

	npm install -g jspm

Install Git and clone this repo:

	git clone https://github.com/AlteredConstants/maestro.git

Then, from the root of the repo:

	npm install
	jspm install

You should now be able to run the local web server:

	npm start

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to see what exists so far.

Enjoy!
